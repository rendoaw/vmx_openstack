## Overview

This repo contains simple Heat template and scripts to launch multiple vMX on OpenStack+Contrail as well as some linux VMs.

Some of the template/script component are taken from official Juniper Heat Template [https://github.com/Juniper/vmx-heat-templates]
While the official template from Juniper provide a complete structure as well as a great detail of the explanation, their focus is to launch vMX that connected to real network.

This repo focuses on how to launch multiple vMX on OpenStack+Contrail that will be connected each other via multiple virtual network but isolated from the rest of the network. 

As an example, 2_nodes_vmx.yaml will launch a simple topology as below:
* number of vMX: 2
    * let's call it vmx101 and vmx102
    
* each vMX consist of 2 VMs, one for RE and one for FPC/PFE

* every virtual network created by this template will be set as L2 mode and configured to ignore the allocated IP. 
    * that's mean you can assign any IP to any ge-0/0/x interface, whether in access or trunk mode

* each VMX will have the following interfaces
    * RE and FPC fxp0 should be connected to public or any virtual network that accessible from outside openstack
        * the virtual network must be exist prior running the launching script
    * All vMX ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 will be connected to the same virtual network, let's call it net_dummy
        * this virtual network will be automatically created by the template
    * All vMX ge-0/0/2 will be connected to the existing virtual network. 
        * for further reference, let's call this virtual network as "net1"
        * this virtual network is to connect vMX to the other VM that launched separately, or even connect to any VM/physical server outside Openstack.
        * the virtual network must be exist prior running the launching script
    * All vMX ge-0/0/3 will be connected to the other existing virtual network
        * similar purpose as ge-0/0/2.
        * for further reference, let's call this virtual network as "net2"
        * the virtual network must be exist prior running the launching script
    * EACH vmx ge-0/0/4 and ge-0/0/5 will have "hairpin" connection. 
        * Each VMX hairpin is isolated, so ge-0/0/4 from vmx01 will not connect to vmx02 ge-0/0/4
        * this virtual network will be automatically created by the template
        * I usually use this network to connect multiple logical system inside a vMX (alternatively you can use lt- interface)
    * All vMX ge-0/0/6 will be connected to the other existing virtual network
        * similar purpose as ge-0/0/2.
        * for further reference, let's call this virtual network as "net3"
        * the virtual network must be exist prior running the launching script
    * All vMX ge-0/0/7 will be connected to the other existing virtual network
        * similar purpose as ge-0/0/2.
        * for further reference, let's call this virtual network as "net4"
        * the virtual network must be exist prior running the launching script
    * All vMX ge-0/0/8 will be connected to the other existing virtual network
        * similar purpose as ge-0/0/2.
        * for further reference, let's call this virtual network as "net5"
        * the virtual network must be exist prior running the launching script
    * All vMX ge-0/0/9 will be connected to the other existing virtual network
        * similar purpose as ge-0/0/2.
        * for further reference, let's call this virtual network as "net6"
        * the virtual network must be exist prior running the launching script

* in summary, we need to have 6 existing virtual network for this template. 
    * in previos heat template version, we only need 2 existing virtual network, but i found out that if we want to simulate any L2 tunneling technology (L2VPN, VPLS, EVPN, etc), it is better to have more vnet.
    * the name of the existing virtual network is not necessary to be net1, net2, and so on. You can use any name, and you can map them inside the env file. 

    
If you notice, this script also depend on my other script [https://github.com/rendoaw/ocsc] to modify Contrail parameter thru REST API. 
This script is needed to change the virtual network properties as below:

```
{
    "forwarding_mode": "l2",
    "allow_transit": true,
    "mirror_destination": false,
    "rpf": "disable"
}
```

* note: 
    * forwarding_mode=l2 can be set from HEAT template or you can also set default forwarding mode = L2 for any future virtual network creation in Contrail page, but i found out that at least in Contrail 3.2.2, i also need to set "rpf = disable" to allow traffic from any arbitrary IP. 
    * this rpf setting seems not configurable from HEAT and there is no way to set the default rpf setting in the global config. The only way that i can find is thru REST API.


## Setup

* Please refer to official Juniper Heat Template [https://github.com/Juniper/vmx-heat-templates] for better understanding of vMX requirement.

* (Optionally) run setup.sh to prepare your environment
* Copy openstackrc-sample to openstackrc
* Adjust openstackrc based on your environment
* Adjust the environment file according to your environment


## Run

* syntax

    ```
    ./vmx_launch.sh -s <stackname> -t <HEAT template file> -e <environment file>
    ```

* example

    ```
    earth:vmx-openstack rendo$ ./vmx_launch.sh -s lab1 -t 2_nodes_vmx.yaml -e 2_nodes_vmx.env

    List of vMX IP:
    vmx101_fpc_port_0 : 100.64.1.11
    vmx101_re_port_0 : 100.64.1.14
    vmx102_fpc_port_0 : 100.64.1.12
    vmx102_re_port_0 : 100.64.1.13
    ```

* wait for few minutes
    * FPC will up pretty quickly
    * But, RE will take sometime to boot and apply the default config that pushed thru config-drive.

* try to ssh to each vmx

## Troubleshooting

* if stack creation is completed but RE image is not pingable. Check the booting status

    ```
    # nova console-log <instance name>

    example:
    # nova console-log lab1-vmx101_re
    ```

## default credentials

* user: admin
* password: juniper1


## Todo

* add more templates
